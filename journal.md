The Chromebook challenge is wrong because it encourages students to break school property just to get attention online.
Chromebooks are given to students to help them learn, and damaging them wastes money and time. It also shows a lack of
respect for the school and the people who work hard to provide these tools. When students do this, they can get in trouble at schoole 
or evenb face legal consequences, which makes the challenge not only harmful but unfair.
  Being safe with technology is very important because devices like CHromebooks can be dangerous if used the wrong way.
  Putting metal objects into charging ports can cause sparks, fires, or even explosions. This puts everyone nerby at risk,
  not just the person doing it. Learning how to use technology safely helps protect people and keeps schools running smoothly. It also 
  teaches students to be responsible and make smart choices.
